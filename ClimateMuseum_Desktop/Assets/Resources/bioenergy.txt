{"name":"bioenergy",
"information":"Discourage or encourage the use of trees, forest waste, and agricultural crops \nto create energy. \n\nBioenergy is energy produced from the burning, or combustion, of living organic \nmaterial such as wood, algae, or agricultural crops. There are a variety of \nbioenergy sources, some of which can be sustainable and others which can \nbe worse than burning coal.",
"examples":"Bioenergy can be promoted manifoldly, e.g.: \n\n\u2022<indent=1em>Government incentives and/or targets to convert land into growing biofuel \nfeedstocks and drive bioenergy development.</indent> \n\n\u2022<indent=1em>Research, development, and investment into new technologies that can \nproduce new forms of biofuels, and vehicles and industry that can use or \nsupport these biofuels.</indent>",
"big messages":"Bioenergy is not a high leverage response to climate change – while it uses \na renewable resource, it still emits large amounts of carbon dioxide and \nfaces supply constraints with scale up.",
"key dynamics":"As bioenergy is subsidized or taxed, notice that the predicted temperature in 2100 \nchanges very little. \nChanges in bioenergy shift the amount of other energy sources, which can mean things like more coal if bioenergy is taxed or less renewables if bioenergy is subsidized. \nBioenergy is only zero-carbon if the feedstock is regrown to account \nfor the carbon emitted. In some areas, trees are being used for bioenergy, which will take decades to regrow to make up for the carbon released when burned.",
"potential co-benefits":"Discouraging bioenergy has several potential co-benefits: \n\n\u2022<indent=1em>Crops and arable land are freed for other uses, such as food production \nwhen bioenergy is discouraged.</indent> \n\n\u2022<indent=1em>Leaving sources of biomass, like forests, intact enables biodiversity \nto be preserved.</indent> \n\n\u2022<indent=1em>A reduction in biomass burning can improve indoor and outdoor air quality \nfrom reduced soot and particulates.</indent> \n\n\u2022<indent=1em>Bioenergy can accelerate deforestation through dependence on wood for \nfuels or through the expansion of bioenergy crops, particularly in the tropics. \nLess deforestation has many benefits including additional carbon sequestration.</indent>",
"equity considerations":"Land used for bioenergy crops can reduce land availability for food production \nand compromise food security. \nFarmer livelihoods can be severely impacted by shifting agriculture markets, \nso steps  should be taken to help workers and farmers transition to shifting \ncrop demands.",
