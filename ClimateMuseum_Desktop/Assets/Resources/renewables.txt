{"name":"renewables",
"information":"Renewable energy includes wind, solar, geothermal, hydropower, and other \ntechnologies that produce energy with little to no carbon dioxide emissions. \n\nNote that nuclear and bioenergy are considered in separate panels.",
"examples":"There are several encouraging approaches to support renewables: \n\n\u2022<indent=1em>Governments offering tax incentives to families installing solar panels on their \nroofs.</indent> \n\n\u2022<indent=1em>Farmers and land owners allowing the installment of wind turbines on their land.</indent> \n\n\u2022<indent=1em>Research and development for improvements to renewable energy \ntechnologies in order to improve efficiencies and/or reduce costs.</indent> \n\n\u2022<indent=1em>Businesses committing to powering themselves with 100% renewable energy.</indent>", 
"big messages":"Subsidizing renewable energy is a helpful way to keep coal and gas in the \nground and reduce future temperature. \nHowever, it isn’t a silver bullet; that is, it isn’t sufficient without other actions.",
"key dynamics":"\u2022<indent=1em><b>Impact:</b> As you encourage renewables, watch demand for Renewables (in green) grow and the demand for Coal (in brown) and Natural Gas (in blue) reduce in the “Global Sources of Primary Energy” graph. \nRenewable energy is already growing steadily in the Baseline scenario so the additional subsidies help reduce emissions but only so much.</indent> \n\n\u2022<indent=1em><b>Rebound effect:</b> Subsidies to renewables decrease energy costs, which \nincreases energy demand over what it would have been otherwise (people \nuse more energy when it is cheap). This rebound effect somewhat reduces \nthe positive impact of encouraging renewable energy. View this dynamic with the graph “Low-Carbon Final Energy Consumption.”</indent> \n\n\u2022<indent=1em><b>Delays:</b> It takes time for the \nsubsidies and encouragement of \nrenewables to show up in installed \ncapacity.</indent>",
"potential co-benefits":"Decreased air and water pollution from switching away from fossil fuel sources \ncan improve public health, worker productivity, and savings for governments \nand households. \n\nFurthermore, renewables can help expand energy access during power outages \nas well as offer opportunities for high- and low-skilled employment.",
"equity considerations":"Although the price of renewable energy infrastructure continues to fall, many \nlow-income communities remain unable to access the technology in both \ndeveloped and developing countries. Working to ensure an equitable energy \ntransition can help everyone to reap the benefits. \n\nFurthermore, policies in many developed countries limit solar and wind subsidy \nprograms to homeowners, who often occupy higher income brackets.",

{"oil":"The more energy arises from renewables, the less oil is needed to fulfill the \nglobal energy demand."},
{"coal":"The more energy arises from renewables, the less coal is needed to fulfill the \nglobal energy demand."},
{"natural gas":"The more energy arises from renewables, the less natural gas is needed to \nfulfill the global energy demand."},
{"deforestation":"Reducing the use and refinery of fossil fuels could prevent further air and \nwater pollution which helps to preserve healthy habitats."}
