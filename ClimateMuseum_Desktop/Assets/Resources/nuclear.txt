"information":"Nuclear power production does not release carbon dioxide, but it produces \nharmful nuclear waste.",
"examples":"There are several arguments supporting the encourage or the discourage of \nusing nuclear power plants. \n\nDiscouraging: \n\n\u2022<indent=1em>Public information campaigns to raise public concerns about the risks of \nnuclear power.</indent> \n\n\u2022<indent=1em>Policies to retire existing nuclear power plants.</indent> \n\nEncouraging: \n\n\u2022<indent=1em>Government policies aimed at handling nuclear waste and reducing costs \nof nuclear power.</indent> \n\n\u2022<indent=1em>Corporate efforts to promote public acceptance of nuclear power plants.</indent>",
"big messages":"Nuclear is not a huge driver of future temperature and competes with the growth \nof renewables and new technology. It could be part of a suite of climate action \nif one is willing to accept the environmental costs - e.g., handling waste \nmaterials and the risk of radiation damage near the plants.",
"key dynamics":"As you subsidize nuclear, watch Nuclear (light blue area) grow, and Coal \n(brown area) and Natural Gas (dark blue area) decrease in the “Global Sources \nof Primary Energy” graph. \n\nNuclear displaces some fossil fuel sources, which keeps more carbon in the \nground and helps reduce temperature modestly. \n\nNuclear competes with all \nenergy sources available, \nso notice also what happens \nto Renewables (green area) \nwhen nuclear is incentivized \n- it decreases too.",
"potential co-benefits":"Discouraging nuclears has several potential co-benefits: \n\n\u2022<indent=1em>Risk of exposure to radiation from a nuclear meltdown or hazardous waste \nis reduced.</indent> \n\n\u2022<indent=1em>Nuclear energy can use more water than coal for electricity production, so \ndiscouraging nuclear power can increase water security and help protect \nwildlife habitats, biodiversity, and ecosystem services.</indent> \n\n\u2022<indent=1em>Nuclear energy is fueled by uranium which can be harmful to mine, so \ndiscouraging nuclear energy can reduce risks to miners.</indent>",
"equity considerations":"Nuclear power plants, uranium mines (which provide the fuel for nuclear power), \nand waste sites are often located in low-income, marginalized communities \nthat often lack resources to advocate for stricter environmental regulations and \noversight. \n\nFurthermore, mining uranium poses significant health risks to miners as well \nas surrounding communities due to water contamination and toxic waste.",
"correlations":"
[
{"coal":"Nuclear displaces some fossil fuels and thus subsidies may lead to a \ndecrease of coal burning."},
{"natural gas":"Nuclear displaces some fossil fuels and thus subsidies may lead to a \ndecrease of natural gas usage."},
{"renewables":"Nuclear competes with renewable energy sources, so if no correction \nmechanisms take place, an increased usage of nuclear might lead to a decrease \nin renewables."},
{"deforestation":"Since nuclear energy can use more water than coal for electricity production, \nreducing nuclear can increase water security and thus help preserving healthy \nwildlife habitats."}
