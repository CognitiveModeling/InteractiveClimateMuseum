{"name":"carbonprice",
"information":"Set a global carbon price that makes coal, oil, and gas more expensive \ndepending on how much carbon dioxide they release. \n\nCarbon dioxide is currently the most destructive greenhouse-gas since its \nconcentration increased most because of human activities in the last centuries. \nOther greenhouse-gases are methane and nitrous gas. \n\nGreenhouse-gases have a huge impact on the climate:
\n\u2022<indent=1em>The sun scalds the earth via solar radiation.</indent> \n\n\u2022<indent=1em>The earth emits heat via infrared radiation.</indent> \n\n\u2022<indent=1em>Greenhouse-gases block infrared radiation.</indent> \n\n\u2022<indent=1em>Reflected infrared radiation prevents earth’s \natmosphere from losing heat which is \nneeded to maintain constant temperature.</indent>",
"examples":"A carbon price can be realised manifoldly: \n\n\u2022<indent=1em>Countries and regions implementing carbon taxes.</indent> \n\n\u2022<indent=1em>Grassroots campaigns generating public support for carbon pricing.</indent>",
"big messages":"Pricing carbon is a high leverage strategy. \nIt both reduces the carbon intensity of the energy supply and reduces \nthe overall energy demand. That said, it is no silver bullet.",
"key dynamics":"When the carbon price is increased, notice that Coal (brown area) reduces \nthe most in the “Global Sources of Primary Energy” graph. It is the most carbon \nintensive source of energy, which makes it the most sensitive to a carbon price. \n\nNatural Gas (dark blue area) decreases as \nwell, although more modestly. \n\nOil (red area) decreases only slightly, even \nthough it is more carbon intensive than gas, \nbecause it is not easily substituted for \nother energy sources (e.g. can’t power \na diesel truck with wind power). \n\nRenewables (green area) increases as the relative cost of wind and solar make \nthem more attractive. \n\nJust like taxing coal, a significant carbon price \nincreases energy costs, which reduces energy \ndemand. View this in the “Final Energy \nConsumption” graph.",
"potential co-benefits":"Carbon pricing has several potential co-benefits: \n\n\u2022<indent=1em>Renewable energy becomes relatively cheaper, which can incentivize \njob creation in the sector.</indent> \n\n\u2022<indent=1em>Reducing the use of fossil fuels improves air quality, increasing healthcare \nsavings and worker productivity.</indent> \n\n\u2022<indent=1em>Revenue from carbon pricing can be allocated to social programs that can \nbe shared with everyone.</indent>",
"equity considerations":"There are certain impacts of carbon pricing that should be considered: \n\n\u2022<indent=1em>As carbon taxes reach effective levels, companies may try to pass costs \nto customers, where the poor are most at risk of being impacted. \nPolicies can be developed that limit this impact.</indent> \n\n\u2022<indent=1em>Workers employed in fossil fuel industries risk losing their jobs if companies \nshrink workforces in response to higher costs of production, so job transition \nplans should be in place and protections for workers ensured.</indent> \n\n\u2022<indent=1em>Due to the political nature of fossil fuel production, government corruption \nand rent-seeking could create the possibility of certain industries \navoiding the carbon price due to loop holes or exemptions.</indent>",
"correlations":"
[
{"energy supply":"An enhanced carbon price will lead to an immedate increase in fossil fuel \ncost and thus to a decrease in usage of coal and natural gas. \nOil will also decrease slightly. On the other hand, renewables become \nhighly attractive due to their constant and relatively cheap price. \n\nBut the overall increase of energy costs will also reduce the energy demand, \nat least for the time needed to expand the renewable sector sufficiently."},
{"transport":"Depending on the carbon price, the mobility behavior changes:
\n\u2022<indent=1em>Low carbon pricing keeps fossil fuels cheap and thus prevents further \ndevelopment in electrification.</indent>
\n\u2022<indent=1em>High carbon pricing entails enhanced costs for fossil fuel and leads to an \nexpansion of the electromobility sector.</indent>"},
{"carbon removal":"Significant carbon pricing motivates companies to invest in new technologies \nfor carbon dioxide removal. \n\nFurthermore, natural systems capable of removing carbon dioxide become \nmore valuable."},
{"emissions":"Active and passive emissions of greenhouse-gases decrease in an \nenvironment with significant carbon pricing."}
