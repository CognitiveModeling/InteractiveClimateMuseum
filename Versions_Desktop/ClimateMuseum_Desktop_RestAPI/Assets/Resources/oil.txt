{"name":"oil",
"information":"Oil is a fossil fuel widely used in cars, ships, and planes; it is also used for \nindustry, heating, and electricity. Access to oil has sparked major conflicts, and \noil spills threaten ecosystems and water quality.",
"examples":"There are several approaches to realise a discouraging of drilling, refining, and \nconsuming oil for energy: \n\n\u2022<indent=1em>Governments imposing limits on oil drilling and exploration, removing subsidies, \nand taxing oil.</indent> \n\n\u2022<indent=1em>Universities, corporations, and individuals divesting from oil companies.</indent> \n\n\u2022<indent=1em>Financial services industry (e.g., banks) or global development institutions \n(e.g., World Bank) limiting access to capital for exploration, drilling, \nrefining, and delivery.</indent>",
"big messages":"When a steep oil tax is the only action implemented, you will not see a dramatic \nchange in temperature, as coal and natural gas demand increases in response, \noffsetting any large reduction of temperature.",
"key dynamics":"When oil is discouraged, by taxing it, watch the red area of Oil go down in the “Global Sources of Primary Energy” graph. \n\nWhen oil is taxed, notice what happens to coal and gas in response. Unless there \nare restrictions on coal and gas, their demand will go up in response to \nexpensive oil. We call this the “squeeze the balloon” problem - depressing fossil \nfuel emissions in one area causes them to pop up in another. \n\nRenewables are also boosted slightly, but the impact is negligible. Adding a \ncarbon price is a good solution to the \n“squeeze the balloon” problem, as it \naddresses all fossil fuels together. \n\nNotice that taxing oil results in an increase in electrification of the vehicle fleet as electric powered modes of transport become more affordable in the face of higher oil prices.",
"potential co-benefits":"A reduction in oil drilling could lead to fewer oil spills, helping protect wildlife \nhabitats, biodiversity, and ecosystem services at production sites and along \ntransportation routes. \n\nFurthermore, a reduced economic dependence on oil can improve national \nsecurity and lower military costs.",
"equity considerations":"The oil industry provides many high-paying jobs for people with technical trade \nbackgrounds. Providing pathways for these people to find new jobs will be \nessential. \n\nFurthermore, oil companies wield enormous economic and political power \nlocally and globally. In order to discourage oil, certain industry protections must \nbe eliminated. There is a history of oil refineries being located in marginalized \ncommunities and companies working to avoid or limit environmental regulations.",
