"information":"Pull carbon dioxide out of the air with new technologies that enhance natural \nremovals or manually sequester and store carbon. \n\nCarbon Dioxide Removal (CDR) technologies include: direct air capture, \nbioenergy with carbon capture and storage (BECCS), biochar, and others \n(but not including coal or gas CCS). CDR is not yet used widely, and most \napproaches face significant barriers to deployment.",
"examples":"Some strategies to enhance technological carbon removal are: \n\n\u2022<indent=1em>Advancements in various CDR technologies through research and \ndevelopment and government policies.</indent> \n\n\u2022<indent=1em>Support from businesses, land owners, and general public to implement \nsuch technologies.</indent>",
"big messages":"Technological carbon removal has the potential to pull significant amounts of \ncarbon dioxide out of the atmosphere. Most of these technologies are still \nundergoing pilot testing, and do not exist at the level needed to deploy at a \nlarge scale.",
"key dynamics":"View the graph “Land for Growing CO_2-Removal Biomass” and note the total amount of land area that all the approaches might require.\n \nAlso, view the graph “Bulk Material for Mineralization” as well to see the scale of industrial production these approaches entail. All in all, technological carbon dioxide removal approaches probabaly will be no silver bullet in the fight against climate change.",
"potential co-benefits":"There are some potential co-benefits of technological carbon removal: \n\n\u2022<indent=1em>Nature-based carbon removal approaches like agricultural soil sequestration \ncan help improve land holder and farmer profits in some cases.</indent> \n\n\u2022<indent=1em>The scale up of many carbon removal approaches would result in vast new \nindustries and businesses which would create jobs.</indent>",
"equity considerations":"Some impacts of technological carbon removal have to be analyzed critically: \n\n\u2022<indent=1em>Approaches like BECCS (bioenergy with carbon capture and storage) require \nlarge areas of land that in some cases could otherwise be used for food \nproduction.</indent> \n\n\u2022<indent=1em>Many of the technological carbon removal approaches have not been \ndeveloped at scale yet and pose unknown risks and consequences to the \ncommunities they are situated within.</indent>",
"correlations":"
[{"deforestation":"Large scale carbon dioxide removal might need huge areas of otherwise intact \nlanscapes, thus entailing deforestation."
