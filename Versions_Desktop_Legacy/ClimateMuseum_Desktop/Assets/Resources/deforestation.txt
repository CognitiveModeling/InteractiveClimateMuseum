{"name":"deforestation",
"information":"Deforestation is the human-driven and natural loss of trees. \nThe first often entails burning and removing forests to clear land for crops \nlike soybeans, corn, or palm oil. Forest protection efforts increase biodiversity \nand can support community resilience.",
"examples":"There are many strategies to achieve a decrease of deforestation: \n\n\u2022<indent=1em> Government policy to preserve forested land and place restrictions on \nindustries such as soybean and/or palm oil.</indent> \n\n\u2022<indent=1em>Increased support for indigenous land rights.</indent> \n\n\u2022<indent=1em>Public support and campaigns to support land preservation.</indent>",
"big messages":"Efforts to reduce deforestation are relatively low leverage for the climate, \nbecause the influence from energy CO2 emissions is so dominant. \nNevertheless, stopping deforestation is still part of a multi pronged effort \nto address climate change. \n\nProtecting forests is helpful for many reasons other than climate action, \nincluding biodiversity conservation and protection of native peoples’ lands.",
"key dynamics":"Highly reducing deforestation emissions reduces temperature less \nthan most people would estimate. \n\nView the “Greenhouse Gas Net Emissions by Gas – Area” graph to see the role of land use (deforestation) CO2 relative to all the other sources of emissions. Most of the emitted CO2 evolve in the energy sector (dark grey area), \nwhereas the land use CO2 holds only a small share (green area). \nOther greenhouse gases are fluorinated gases (yellow area), \nmethane (bright blue area) and nitrous oxide (purple area). \n\nIn the scenario shown in the \ngraph, deforestation is highly \nreduced since 2021, whereas \nemissions from other sources \nand carbon dioxide removal \n(bright gray area, invisible) \nremain in the status quo.",
"potential co-benefits":"Decreasing deforestation has several potential co-benefits: \n\n\u2022<indent=1em>Forests protect biodiversity and provide ecosystem services \nand food sources.</indent> \n\n\u2022<indent=1em>Forest preservation reduces erosion and prevents soil loss.</indent> \n\n\u2022<indent=1em>Forests provide livelihoods for people (e.g. small-scale resource gathering \nand sustainable forestry) that ca be lost when land is shifted to other uses.",
"equity considerations":"Some equity aspects of deforestation should be considered: \n\n\u2022<indent=1em>Forest preservation efforts have sometimes restricted the land access \nof indigenous people who have lived sustainably on the land for \ngenerations.</indent> \n\n\u2022<indent=1em>Policies should be created with local stakeholder engagement.",
"correlations":
[
{"methane & co":"Decreasing deforestation entails fewer new pastures and agricultural crop land. \nThis leads to a decreased amount of methane releasing sources like cows, \nagriculture, natural gas drilling and waste.\n\nFurthermore, the use of fertilizers in this areas is prevented \nand thus the emission of nitrous oxide."},
{"bioenergy":"A decrease of deforestation can lead to a decrease of sources of biomass: \n\n\u2022<indent=1em>Fewer wood from forest clearance.</indent> \n\n\u2022<indent=1em>Less space for expansion of bioenergy crops, particularly in the tropics.</indent> \n\nFurthermore, a decrease of deforestation without other changes in \nenergy supply might lead to an increasing demand of fossile energy sources."},
{"carbon removal":"If deforestation is decreased, natural carbon dioxide removal mechanisms \ntake place. \n\nFurthermore, a decrease of deforestation might pave the way for afforestation, \nwhich can be complemented by technological carbon removal."}
