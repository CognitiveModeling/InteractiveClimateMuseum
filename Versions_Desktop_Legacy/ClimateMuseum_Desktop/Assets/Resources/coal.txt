{"name":"coal",
"information":"Coal is the most harmful fossil fuel in terms of carbon emissions, as well as \nin air pollutants that cause severe health impacts. It is a dominant source of \nenergy globally, however, because it is relatively inexpensive to mine and transport. \nDiscourage or encourage mining coal and burning it in power plants \ncan lead to significant changes in the energy sector.",
"examples":"A reduction in coal mining can be realised manifoldly, e.g.: \n\n\u2022<indent=1em>Government policies that phase out power plants or make them more \nexpensive in any way, such as taxes on coal.</indent> \n\n\u2022<indent=1em>Financial services industry (e.g. banks) or global development institutions \n(e.g. World Bank) limiting access to capital for new coal mining, refining, \nand power plant infrastructure.</indent>",
"big messages":"Discouraging coal is a high leverage strategy for reducing future temperature \nchange. It keeps coal in the ground, increases the cost of energy, and reduces \nenergy demand. \nDiscouraging coal also improves public health and saves medical costs through \nimproved air quality.",
"key dynamics":"When coal is discouraged, by taxing it, watch the brown area of Coal go down in the “Sources of Primary Energy” graph. It is one of the most sensitive energy supplies to any increase in cost. Unlike oil, it can often be substituted for natural gas and renewables.\n \nTaxing coal also reduces energy demand. When energy prices are higher, people tend to use energy more efficiently and conserve energy. However, tax policies must be implemented with considerations for poor and working-class communities who can be harmfully impacted by high energy prices.",
"potential co-benefits":"Reducing coal mining and burning has several potential co-benefits: \n\n\u2022<indent=1em>Reduced air pollutants from coal burning improves air quality and health \noutcomes for surrounding communities. </indent> \n\n\u2022<indent=1em>Less coal mining reduces heavy metal drainage and waste from mine sites \nwhich improves water quality and helps protect wildlife habitats, biodiversity, \nand ecosystem services.</indent>",
"equity considerations":"Some aspects have to be considered concerning changes in coal usage: \n\n\u2022<indent=1em>Taxing coal can raise energy costs for households and businesses that rely \non coal for energy needs. Therefore, tax policies must be implemented with \nconsiderations for poor and working-class communities who can be harmfully \nimpacted by high energy prices. </indent> \n\n\u2022<indent=1em>Low-income communities often suffer the worst health outcomes yet \nmake up the majority of individuals who produce coal. Providing pathways \nfor these people to find new jobs will be essential.</indent>",
"correlations":"
[
{"natural gas":"Since coal often can be substituted by natural gas, its reduction leads to an \nincrease in demand of natural gas. This increase could be prevented by a \nsignificant carbon pricing."}
{"renewables":"If coal price increases, energy from renewable sources becomes relativly \ncheaper, thus leading to an enhanced use of regenerative energy sources."},
{"deforestation":"Reducing the usage of coal reduces the need of accessing new areas for \ncoal mining. Therefore, fewer healthy habitats are deforested."}
{"t efficiency":"Taxing coal might also reduce energy demand. \nWhen energy prices are higher, people tend to use energy more efficiently \nand conserve energy. \nThis entails an enhancement in transport efficiency."}
{"bi efficiency":"Taxing coal probably also reduces energy demand. \nWhen energy prices are higher, people tend to use energy more efficiently \nand conserve energy. \nTherefore, buildings and industry will be designed mor efficiently."
