"information":"Increase or decrease the energy efficiency of buildings, appliances, and \nother machines. \nEnergy efficiency includes things like building well-insulated homes and \nreducing the amount of energy factories use. \nEnergy efficient practices can save money through reduced energy needs \nas well as improve the health of people in those buildings.",
"examples":"Higher energy efficiencies in buildings and industry can be realised in different \nways: \n\n\u2022<indent=1em>Individuals and businesses insulating buildings, purchasing energy efficient \ntechnologies (motors, lighting, appliances, servers, HVAC systems), and \nconserving energy.</indent> \n\n\u2022<indent=1em>Government policies such as tax breaks and performance standards to \nincentivize energy efficient products and practices.</indent> \n\n\u2022<indent=1em>Research and development into high efficiency technologies.</indent>",
"big messages":"Energy efficiency of buildings and industry is high leverage. \nIt leads to less energy use, which leads to coal, oil, and gas being used. \nIt also saves families, business, and communities money.",
"key dynamics":"As less energy is used for buildings and industry, notice how all the energy \nsources decline in the “Global Sources of Primary Energy” graph - \nparticularly coal and gas when they are the main sources of electricity. \n\nLess fossil fuels are burned so CO_2 emissions go down and global \ntemperature change is lowered dramatically. \n\nImprovements in energy intensity of new capital also reduce energy demand. \nExplore this in the “Final Energy Consumption” graph, where the Current \nScenario (blue line) is lower than Business as Usual (black line).",
"potential co-benefits":"Some potential co-benefits of increased energy efficiency are: \n\n\u2022<indent=1em>Increased industrial efficiency and reduced energy demand can reduce \nair pollution, which increases healthcare savings and worker productivity.</indent> \n\n\u2022<indent=1em>Lowering electricity bills for households, businesses, and governments \nincreases energy security.</indent> \n\n\u2022<indent=1em>Insulated homes remain cooler in the summer and warmer in the winter, \nwhen weather events and grid-overload cause outages.</indent> \n\n\u2022<indent=1em>Retrofitting buildings and homes to be more efficient can create many jobs.</indent>",
"equity considerations":"There are some impacts of higher energy efficiency to consider: \n\n\u2022<indent=1em>The up-front capital costs of efficiency improvements may not be accessible \nto lower income individuals and small businesses.</indent> \n\n\u2022<indent=1em>In some places, policies are directed at property owners, inhibiting renters, \nwho are often lower income, from accessing the benefits.</indent>",

[
{"deforestation":"If energy demand decreases, fewer fossil fuels will be needed and thus more \nhealthy habitats can be protected."},
{"energy supply":"The less energy consumed by buildings and industry, the less energy has to \nbe provided. This impacts fossil fuels and bioenergy as well as renewables."},
