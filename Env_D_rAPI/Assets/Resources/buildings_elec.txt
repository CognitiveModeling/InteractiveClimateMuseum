"information":"Increase or decrease the use of electricity, instead of fuels like oil or gas, \nin buildings, appliances, heating systems, and other machines. \nUsing electric motors only helps reduce emissions if the electricity is from \nlow carbon sources like solar and wind.",
"examples":"Eletrification of buildings and industry can be increased by several strategies: \n\n\u2022<indent=1em>Increase in public interest for replacing oil and gas heating furnaces in \nbuildings with electric heating systems.</indent> \n\n\u2022<indent=1em>Research and development into various electric motors and systems that \ncould enable wind and solar to replace oil and gas fired industrial facilities.</indent>",
"big messages":"Electrification of buildings and industry can help, particularly when renewable \nenergy is already encouraged or fossil fuels are discouraged.",
"key dynamics":"When there is more efficient electrical systems powering building and industries, \nnotice that Natural Gas (dark blue area) and Coal (brown area) move down \nin the “Global Sources of Primary Energy” graph.",
"potential co-benefits":"Many co-benefits might come along with an increased electrification of \nbuildings and industry: \n\n\u2022<indent=1em>Improved air quality at the source increases healthcare savings and worker \nproductivity.</indent> \n\n\u2022<indent=1em>Eliminating demand for natural gas lines to buildings also eliminates the risks \nfrom fire and explosion.</indent> \n\n\u2022<indent=1em>Noise pollution from motor engines, generators, and furnaces is reduced.</indent> \n\n\u2022<indent=1em>Air quality for individuals working/living in and around the structures is \nimproved, which increases healthcare savings and worker productivity.</indent>",
"equity considerations":"Some impacts of an increased electrification of buildings and industry have to \nbe kept in mind: \n\n\u2022<indent=1em>The up-front capital costs of retrofitting buildings and heating systems to be \nentirely electric may not be accessible to lower income individuals and small \nbusinesses.</indent> \n\n\u2022<indent=1em>Exposure to household air pollution is unevenly distributed within and across \ncountries, to which negative health effects and poverty are strongly correlated. </indent>",
"correlations":"
[
{"deforestation":"Reducing the drilling and mining of fossil fuels would lead to a reduction of \ndeforestation since fewer new refinery and mining locations would be established."},
{"energy supply":"Research and development into various electric motors and systems that could \nenable wind and solar industrial facilities might lead to significant changes in \nthe energy sector. \nFurhtermore, subsidiations in renewables could enhance electrification of \nbuildings and industry."}
