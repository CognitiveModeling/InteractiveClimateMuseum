{"name":"afforestation",
"information":"Plant new forests and restore old forests. \n\nAs trees grow, they draw carbon out of the air, which reduces the concentration \nof carbon dioxide. However, without care, large-scale afforestation can \ncompromise biodiversity and historical land rights.",
"examples":"There are some strategies to enhance afforestation: \n\n\u2022<indent=1em>Government policies, incentives, and funding to identify available land, \nplant trees, and manage forests.</indent> \n\n\u2022<indent=1em>Business, land owner, and public support for large scale tree planting.</indent>",
"big messages":"Afforestation has the potential to pull significant amounts of carbon dioxide \nout of the atmosphere, but land availability and other effects should be considered. \n\nIt would take an immense amount of land to make a large impact \non temperature change.",
"key dynamics":"Growing more trees boosts global removal of CO_2 from the atmosphere, as \nphotosynthesis pulls carbon into biomass and soils. Watch the temperature decrease modestly as a result. All in all, Afforestation does not \nstrongly affect the climate: \nthe land area of India is 300 million hectares, so if we were \nto forest an area of that size we would still not see much change in temperature. Explore the graph “Land for Carbon Dioxide Removal” to see this.",
"potential co-benefits":"Some potential co-benefits of afforestation are: \n\n\u2022<indent=1em>New forests can create new ecosystems and protect existing wildlife habitats, \nbiodiversity, and ecosystem services.</indent> \n\n\u2022<indent=1em>Larger and healthier tree canopies in cities reduce urban heat island effects \nand energy needed for heating and cooling.</indent> \n\n\u2022<indent=1em>Jobs are created in tree planting, care, and maintenance.</indent>",
"equity considerations":"Impacts of afforestation on the population and environement have to be \nconsidered: \n\n\u2022<indent=1em>Afforestation entails shifting large areas of land into forests. \nThis can sometimes result in monocultures of trees that are all the same age, \nwhich does not contribute to healthy biodiversity as much as natural forests.</indent> \n\n\u2022<indent=1em>Large shifts in land can compromise historic land access, so involving \nlow-income and minority communities, including Indigenous peoples, \nin the process of policy development and implementation is essential.</indent>",
"correlations":"
{"deforestation":"Efforts to afforestate will entail better protection of still intact habitats and \nthus prevent further deforestation."}"
