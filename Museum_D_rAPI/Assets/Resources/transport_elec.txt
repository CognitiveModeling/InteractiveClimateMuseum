"information":"Increase or decrease purchases of new electric cars, trucks, buses, trains, \nand ships. \n\nUsing electric motors for transport helps reduce greenhouse gas emissions \nand air pollution if the electricity is from low-carbon sources like solar and wind.",
"examples":"Purchases of new electric cars, trucks, buses, trains, and ships can be \npromoted in different ways:\n\n\u2022<indent=1em>Investments into electric vehicle charging infrastructure.</indent> \n\n\u2022<indent=1em>Research and development into the technologies for vehicles, batteries, \nand charging.</indent> \n\n\u2022<indent=1em>Corporate commitments to sales of electric vehicles.</indent> \n\n\u2022<indent=1em>Programs to offer rebates and incentives to electric car purchases.</indent>",
"big messages":"If the world is dependent on coal and natural gas for electric power, the net \neffect of electrification is only a slight change in in emissions and temperature. \n\nSwitching to electric modes of transport makes the biggest impact for the \nclimate when electrical energy sources are low-carbon.",
"key dynamics":"As you increase Transport Electrification, there are two main forces that affect future \ntemperature: \n\n\u2022<indent=1em>Overall efficiency is greater for electrified transport than for internal \ncombustion engines - in general, less fuel is used to power transport with \nelectricity than oil.</indent> \n\n\u2022<indent=1em>Oil, in the “Global Sources of Primary Energy” graph, goes down as we \nelectrify transport. At the same time, primary energy demand for coal, renewables, and to a more limited extent, natural gas, all increase to power the rise in electrical demand.</indent>",
"potential co-benefits":"Encouraging electrification has several potential co-benefits: \n\n\u2022<indent=1em>Improved air quality from fewer internal combustion engines increases \nhealthcare savings and worker productivity.</indent> \n\n\u2022<indent=1em>Jobs are created in the manufacturing and sales of electric batteries and \nengines.</indent>",
"equity considerations":"There are certain aspects to think of if Transport Electrification is enhanced: \n\n\u2022<indent=1em>Although costs are coming down, electric vehicles may not be affordable or \navailable to everyone.</indent> \n\n\u2022<indent=1em>Mining of lithium and copper, two necessary ingredients for the batteries used \nin electric vehicles, can be damaging to precious ecosystems and threaten \nthe well-being of communities near mining sites.</indent> \n\n\u2022<indent=1em>Electric charging station locations may not be accessible or the electric battery \nrange may be insufficient for some situations.</indent>",
"correlations":"
[
{"energy supply":"If Transport Electrification is increased, especially the usage of oil is decreased. \nCoal and natural gas, on the other hand, might increase due to an enhanced \nelectrical demand, if there is no carbon pricing or other taxes. \nRenewables increase only slightly in the absence fossil fuel taxing."},
{"deforestation":"The exploitation of new mining sectors for lithium and copper extraction might \ncause destruction of healthy wildlife habitats. "}
