{"name":"natural gas",
"information":"Natural gas is a fossil fuel used for electricity, heating, and industry. When \nburned, it releases carbon dioxide (although less than coal and oil) and, \nif leaked into the air, it contains high amounts of methane. \n\nNatural gas drilling uses large amounts of water and can cause contamination.",
"examples":"Several strategies can lead to a decreased drilling and burning of natural gas \nfor energy: \n\n\u2022<indent=1em>Governments implementing laws against fracking and taxes on natural gas.</indent> \n\n\u2022<indent=1em> Financial services industry (e.g., banks) or global development institutions \n(e.g., World Bank) limiting access to capital.</indent>",
"big messages":"More natural gas is not an effective long-term strategy for the climate - \nit is less carbon intensive than coal, but its infrastructure has a long life \nso it competes with the adoption of lower-carbon alternatives as they scale up.",
"key dynamics":"If gas is taxed, in absence of other policies, primary energy demand for natural gas decreases, but high-carbon coal and oil demand increases slightly, with no considerable net benefit on emissions or temperature change. \n\nWe call this the “squeeze the balloon” problem – depressing fossil fuel \nemissions in one area causes them to pop up in another. \nAdding a carbon price is a good solution to the “squeeze the balloon” problem, \nas it addresses all fossil fuels together.",
"potential co-benefits":"Gas drilling is water intensive, so limiting extraction can improve water security \nand quality at the source of production and protect wildlife habitats, biodiversity, \nand ecosystem services. \nThere are concerns about the health and environmental impacts of the gas \ndrilling approach, known as fracking, that have led many places to ban it.", 
"equity considerations":"Generally speaking, natural gas production in developed countries (especially \nUSA) is disproportionately located near low-income and minority communities. \nThere have been cases where wealthy white communities have successfully \nresisted natural gas development and it has shifted to low-income communities \npredominantly inhabited by people of color. Low income communities often have \nless ability to influence development. \nLimited data on the placements of fracking and power plant sites in developing \ncountries exists, yet macro-level research shows that low-income communities \nand communities of color disproportionately experience the negative impacts \nof natural gas drilling and burning.",
"correlations":"
[
{"coal":"Since natural gas often can be substituted by coal, its reduction leads to an \nincrease in demand of coal. This increase could be prevented by a significant \ncarbon pricing."},
{"oil":"If natural gas is taxed, oil consumption increases due to its relative cheapness \ncompared to renewables. Taxing carbon dioxide emissions could prevent this \n“squeeze the balloon“ problem."},
{"methane & co":"When natural gas is leaked to the air, it contains lots of methane. \nSince methane is a greenhouse gas effecting the climate much stronger \nthan carbon dioxide, its use should be prevented as far as possible."},
{"deforestation":"Since gas drilling is water intensive and possibly dangerous for surrounding \nlandscapes, leakages and other incidents might entail a destruction of \nneighbouring habitats. Especially in areas with large tree populations this \ncould have an even deeper impact on the climate."}
