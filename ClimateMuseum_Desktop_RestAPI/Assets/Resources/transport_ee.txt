"information":"Increase or decrease the energy efficiency of vehicles, shipping, air travel, \nand transportation systems. \n\nEnergy efficiency includes things like hybrid cars, expanded public transport, \nand ways that people can get around using less energy. \n\nAdopting more energy efficient practices, such as cycling and walking, can \nimprove public health and save money.",
"examples":"An increase of energy efficiency can be reached by several strategies: \n\n\u2022<indent=1em>Individuals changing their personal behavior to increase walking, biking, \nusing public transit, carpooling, living in higher density neighborhoods, \npurchasing more efficient vehicles, reducing flying, or telecommuting.</indent> \n\n\u2022<indent=1em>Public or corporate policies such as increasing parking prices, investing in \npublic transit, offering tax breaks for efficient vehicles, rewarding carpooling, \nbuilding bike lanes, creating high density pedestrian friendly urban areas, or \nperformance standards that mandate specific fuel efficiency.</indent> \n\n\u2022<indent=1em>Research and development into high efficiency technologies for shipping, \nvehicles, and air travel.</indent>",
"big messages":"",
"key dynamics":"Watch Oil (red area) decrease in the “Global Sources of Primary Energy” graph \nas the world increases the efficiency of its transport. Less oil is burned, and coal \nand gas fall as well as electrified transport becomes more efficient. \n\nFurthermore, view the “Final Energy Consumption” graph to see the fall in \nenergy demand. Less demand for energy also means prices are lower.",
"potential co-benefits":"There are several positive co-benefits of higher transport efficiency: \n\n\u2022<indent=1em>Improved air quality as a result of less burning of fossil fuels increases \nhealthcare savings and worker productivity.</indent> \n\n\u2022<indent=1em>Better fuel efficiency means energy costs are lower.</indent> \n\n\u2022<indent=1em>Mass transit, like buses and trains, can reduce traffic congestion and noise.</indent> \n\n\u2022<indent=1em>Improved biking and walking infrastructure increases physical activity and \nsafety, which results in sizeable health savings.</indent>",
"equity considerations":"In some developed countries, such as the United States, pedestrian and \ncycle-friendly infrastructure has been concentrated in wealthy communities, \nleaving out low-income families and people of color. \n\nWhen mass transit options improve or operating costs decrease with fuel \nefficient vehicle use, social equality may improve, as low-income individuals \nhave more transportation options to meet their needs.",
