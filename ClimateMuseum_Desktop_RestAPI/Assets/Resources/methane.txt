{"name":"methane",
"information":"Decrease or increase greenhouse gas emissions from methane, nitrous oxide, \nand the F-gases. \n\nMethane is released from sources like cows, agriculture, natural gas drilling, \nand waste. Nitrous oxide comes from fertilizers. The f-gases includes \nHFCs (Hydrofluorocarbon), PFCs (Perfluorocarbons), and others that are used \nin industry and consumer goods like air conditioners.",
"examples":"Greenhouse gas emissions can be decreased in several ways: \n\n\u2022<indent=1em>Decreased meat consumption.</indent> \n\n\u2022<indent=1em>Modified agricultural practices such as increasing digestion of manure and \ndecreasing fertilizer use.</indent> \n\n\u2022<indent=1em>Decreased methane leakage from oil and gas industries.</indent> \n\n\u2022<indent=1em>Increased capturing of gases emitted from landfills.</indent> \n\n\u2022<indent=1em>Research and development into substitutions for F-gases in industrial \nprocesses.</indent>",
"big messages":"Reducing methane, nitrous oxide, and the F-gases is high leverage, although \nmany approaches to reducing these emissions need more research and \nsupport to scale up.",
"key dynamics":"Methane, N2O, and F-gas emissions comprise 30% of current greenhouse gas \nemissions and are key in reducing to address climate change.",
"potential co-benefits":"There are many co-benefits accompanying strategies to reduce greenhouse \ngas emissions: \n\n\u2022<indent=1em>Plant-based diets have been shown to be healthier for individuals and have \nless impact on ecosystems.</indent> \n\n\u2022<indent=1em>Sustainable and plant-based agriculture produces more food with fewer \nresources, which increases food security.</indent> \n\n\u2022<indent=1em>Reducing methane leakage from natural gas systems can save money.</indent> \n\n\u2022<indent=1em>Less nitrogen-rich fertilizer run off can reduce water pollution, decrease \neutrophication, and increase marine health.</indent>",
"equity considerations":"Reducing greenhouse gas emissions might impact culture and society: \n\n\u2022<indent=1em>Many cultural values are attached to certain foods, meaning change to more \nplant-based diets could require a large societal shift.</indent> \n\n\u2022<indent=1em>Policies implemented without care may threaten food security for certain \nindividuals and communities. For example, rice paddies, a large methane \ncontributor, are a main dietary staple for many countries.</indent> \n\n\u2022<indent=1em>Local economies and employment can be threatened in communities which \ncurrently rely on industrial, large-scale farming practices as their main livelihood.</indent>",

{"deforestation":"If methane and other emissions are taxed, fewer pastries for meat production \nare needed as well as pollution of the environement decreases. \nThis entails a decrease in human-driven and natural deforestation."}
